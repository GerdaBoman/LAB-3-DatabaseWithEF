# LAB-3-DatabaseWithEF

Lab 3 project completed by Sofie+Gerda

To make sure that everything works as it should, you should first download a back-up database file and install that database on (localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB server.
This way the database will be created with all the test data that is needed to be able to test the program.

Efter you have installed the database, check that the connection string matches (connection string can be foound in appsettings.json or even in BokHandelContext).

If everyhting matches then there should be no problem to run the program directly. There is already easy user inteferance to test quickly data with tall the methods that are there.
